# Workstation

Some scripts and stuff I use to help build my workstation.

Mostly for when I have a new machine and want to get it up and running again as quickly at possible.

This is for adding extra repositories (and installing the appropriate software) I use regularly and for installing Ubuntu supported softwares.
